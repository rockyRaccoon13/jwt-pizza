# Incident: 2025-04-08 13:11 UTC

## Summary

```md
Somewhere between the hours of 12:39 UTC and 13:11 UTC (a period in which traffic was not simulated) on 2025-04-08 all pizza orders began to fail. This outage lasted until 13:24 UTC and all orders made during the outage were lost.

The event was triggered by the failure of the third party pizza factory, which manages the processing of orders and creation of pizza jwts.

The incident was resolved by reporting the outage to the third-party pizza factory via a link found in the body of the 500 http response from the factory during its outage.
```

## Detection

```md
The incident was detected when a Grafana OnCall alerted Benson via SMS, notifying him of an alert that pizza orders failing more than succeeding. Detection time could have been reduced if traffic had been continuously, also allowing for a narrower estimate of the incident start time.
```

## Impact

```md
For 13 minutes between 13:11 UTC and 13:24 UTC on 08/04/25 all of the (simulated) users who attempted to make an order experienced the incident.
```

## Timeline and Response

```md
All times are UTC.

- _12:39_ - Simulated Traffic was paused after hours of continually running
- _13:11_ - Simulating Traffic was restarted by Benson. Metrics begin to show Pizza Orders Failing more than succeeding. Benson begins looking through metrics.
- _13:12_ - Benson receives SMS notification from Grafana OnCall notifying that the alert "Pizza Orders Failing > Success" was firing. Benson fails to acknowledge alert, even though he is working on the problem. Benson starts looking at backend code to look for possible failure points in the order router.
- _13:17_ - Benson receives another SMS notification from Grafana OnCall but ignores it. He begins to look through front end code and tests UI via the public site on a Chrome browser.
- _13:23_ - Benson uses dev tools to track network requests and responses and tries to make an order as a logged in user. Benson reads the failure response body and finds the pizza factory outage reporting link. Benson then sends a get request to the link and recives a message notifying him he has passed the chaos testing
- _13:24_ - Benson marks the OnCall alert as resolved as order metrics return to normal behavior -- orders are passing.
```

## Root cause

```md
The root cause is the pizza factory service failing to create pizza orders and waiting for a report of the outage.
```

## Resolution

> [!NOTE]
> Describe how the service was restored and the incident was deemed over. Detail how the service was successfully restored and you knew how what steps you needed to take to recovery.
> Depending on the scenario, consider these questions: How could you improve time to mitigation? How could you have cut that time by half?

```md
**EXAMPLE**:
By Increasing the size of the BuildEng EC3 ASG to increase the number of nodes available to support the workload and reduce the likelihood of scheduling on oversubscribed nodes

Disabled the Escalator autoscaler to prevent the cluster from aggressively scaling-down
Reverting the Build Engineering scheduler to the previous version.
```

## Action items

```md
1. Manual auto reporting to pizza factory when factory sends a 500 response.
